## Hero's Journey

The About page should follow narrative structure, not list milestones.

### Classic Structure

```
1. THE ORDINARY WORLD
   Life before the problem was solved

2. THE CALL TO ADVENTURE
   The problem discovered / frustration felt

3. THE ORDEAL
   Challenges faced while building solution

4. THE TRANSFORMATION
   How the solution came to be

5. THE RETURN
   Now helping others on the same journey
```

### Example

**Boring:**
> "Founded in 2015, we are a leading provider of accounting software."

**Story-driven:**
> "In 2015, our founder Sarah was drowning in spreadsheets. As a small business owner, she spent 20 hours a month on bookkeeping—time she could have spent with customers. So she built what she needed: accounting that just works. Today, 50,000 businesses use our platform to get that time back."

## Human Connection

Humanise the brand through specific, relatable details.

### Real People, Not Stock Photos

- **Real team photos:** Actual employees, not models
- **Names and roles:** Connect faces to functions
- **Personal touches:** Hobbies, pets, quirks
- **Behind-the-scenes:** Office, process, culture

### Specificity Creates Connection

| Generic | Specific |
|---------|----------|
| "We're passionate about quality" | "Every product is tested 47 times before shipping" |
| "Customer-focused company" | "Our support team responds in 12 minutes on average" |
| "Innovative solutions" | "Our founder holds 3 patents in widget design" |

### Founder Voice

First-person narratives create intimacy:
- "I remember the moment I realised..."
- "We almost gave up in 2018..."
- "When I hear from customers who..."

## Vulnerability

Transparency about challenges builds trust.

### What to Share

- **Early struggles:** Funding challenges, failed launches
- **Learning moments:** What you got wrong
- **Values in action:** Decisions that cost money but aligned with beliefs
- **Ongoing challenges:** What you're still working on

### What Not to Share

- Unresolved legal issues
- Customer-damaging failures without resolution
- Internal conflicts without context
- Anything that undermines trust in product

### Vulnerability Formula

```
[Challenge faced] + [What we learned] + [How we're better now]
```

**Example:**
> "Our first version crashed constantly. We heard the frustration. We rebuilt from the ground up. Today, we have 99.99% uptime—and we're never going back to cutting corners."

## Visual Storytelling

Words + images create complete narrative.

### Photo Guidelines

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| Real employees | Stock business photos |
| Action shots (working, meeting) | Staged handshakes |
| Candid moments | Overly polished |
| Authentic workspace | Generic offices |
| Diverse representation | Homogeneous teams |

### Visual Narrative Elements

- **Timeline graphics:** Key milestones visualised
- **Behind-the-scenes photos:** Process, culture
- **Customer photos:** Real users (with permission)
- **Founder media:** Video messages, signatures

### Video Impact

Video on About page:
- Increases time on page
- Creates emotional connection
- Communicates personality
- Differentiates from competitors

## Challenger Brand Strategy

Small businesses can outmessage corporate giants through authenticity.

### David vs Goliath

- **Giants:** Resources, scale, brand recognition
- **Challengers:** Authenticity, agility, personality

### Challenger Copy Tactics

1. **Name the enemy:** (Not competitors, but the problem)
   - "We're tired of banks treating you like a number"

2. **Take a stand:** Clear values, even if polarising
   - "We don't do fast fashion"

3. **Show the humans:** Real faces, real stories

4. **Embrace limitations:** Turn constraints into features
   - "We're small, so we know every customer by name"

5. **Create community:** "Us vs them" mentality with customers
