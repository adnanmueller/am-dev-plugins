## Empowerment Marketing

Shift from "agitating pain points" to highlighting potential.

### Pain Point Problems

**Traditional approach:**
- Make user feel inadequate
- Amplify fear/anxiety
- Promise to "fix" them

**Issues:**
- Creates negative association with brand
- Users fatigued by fear-mongering
- Short-term compliance, not loyalty

### Empowerment Approach

| Pain-Point (Avoid) | Empowerment (Use) |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| "Don't be a failure at the gym" | "Unlock your full athletic potential" |
| "Your skin is aging badly" | "Reveal your natural radiance" |
| "You're losing money every day" | "Start maximising your returns" |
| "Your competitors are beating you" | "Lead your industry" |

### Formula

```
Instead of: "You have [problem]. That's bad. We fix it."
Use: "Imagine [positive outcome]. We help you get there."
```

### Benefits

- Positive brand association
- Long-term loyalty vs transactional
- Word-of-mouth more likely
- Aligns with modern consumer values

## Dark Patterns

Manipulative design/copy tricks that deceive users.

### Types to Avoid

**Confirmshaming**
Guilting users into actions via emotional manipulation.
- Bad: "No thanks, I don't want to save money"
- Good: "No thanks" or "Maybe later"

**Hidden Costs**
Revealing fees late in checkout.
- Always: Transparent pricing upfront

**Forced Continuity**
Making cancellation difficult.
- Always: Easy unsubscribe, clear processes

**Trick Questions**
Confusing wording to get unintended consent.
- Always: Plain language, logical opt-ins

**Roach Motel**
Easy to enter, hard to exit.
- Always: Clear exit paths, account deletion

**Bait and Switch**
Promise one thing, deliver another.
- Always: Accurate descriptions, honest claims

**Misdirection**
Using design/copy to draw attention from important information.
- Always: Important terms visible, not hidden

### Legal Considerations

Dark patterns increasingly face:
- Consumer protection lawsuits
- Regulatory fines (FTC, ACCC)
- Reputation damage
- Terms of service violations

## Inclusive Language

Write for all readers, expanding addressable market.

### Gender-Neutral Language

| Gendered | Inclusive |
|----------|-----------|
| "Businessman" | "Business professional" |
| "Mankind" | "Humanity" |
| "He/she" | "They" |
| "Guys" | "Everyone" / "Team" |
| "Manpower" | "Workforce" |

### Ability-Inclusive Language

| Ableist | Inclusive |
|---------|-----------|
| "Crazy deal" | "Amazing deal" |
| "Lame excuse" | "Poor excuse" |
| "Blind to the facts" | "Unaware of the facts" |
| "Suffering from" | "Living with" |
| "Wheelchair-bound" | "Wheelchair user" |

### Age-Neutral Language

| Ageist | Inclusive |
|--------|-----------|
| "Senior moment" | (avoid) |
| "Millennial" (derogatory) | (avoid stereotyping) |
| "Young and dynamic" | "Innovative" |
| "Old-fashioned" | "Traditional" |

### Cultural Sensitivity

- Avoid idioms that don't translate globally
- Be aware of cultural colour associations
- Check date/number formatting for locales
- Avoid assumptions about holidays/traditions

## Representation

Examples and visuals should reflect diverse users.

### In Copy Examples

| Narrow | Inclusive |
|--------|-----------|
| "Perfect for busy mums" | "Perfect for busy parents" |
| Single user type | Varied scenarios |
| One demographic | Multiple demographics |

### In Case Studies

- Feature diverse customers
- Vary industries, sizes, locations
- Include different founder backgrounds
- Represent different use cases

### In Imagery

- Diverse ages, ethnicities, abilities
- Authentic (not tokenistic)
- Varied body types
- Different family structures
- Representation in leadership roles

### Tokenism Warning

Performative diversity backfires:
- Stock photos of diverse groups without substance
- Single diverse testimonial
- Diversity claims without backing

**Better:** Genuine, consistent representation throughout.

## Long-Term Trust

Ethical copy builds sustainable relationships.

### Trust Equation

```
Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation
```

**Increase:**
- Credibility: Accurate claims, expertise
- Reliability: Consistent delivery, follow-through
- Intimacy: Personal connection, vulnerability

**Decrease:**
- Self-Orientation: Appearing only interested in profit

### Honesty Practices

1. **Accurate claims:** Can you prove every statement?
2. **Clear limitations:** What doesn't the product do?
3. **Realistic expectations:** Will users get promised results?
4. **Transparent pricing:** All costs visible upfront
5. **Honest comparisons:** Fair competitor mentions

### Long-Term vs Short-Term

| Short-Term Tactics | Long-Term Approach |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Clickbait headlines | Accurate headlines |
| Fake scarcity | Real inventory updates |
| Manufactured urgency | Genuine limited offers |
| Exaggerated claims | Provable benefits |
| Hidden terms | Transparent policies |
