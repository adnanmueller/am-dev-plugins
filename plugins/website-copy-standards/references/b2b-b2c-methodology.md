## Core Differences

Same psychology (emotion + logic), different execution.

**B2B:** Long cycles, multiple stakeholders, large budgets, risk-averse
**B2C:** Short cycles, single decision-maker, emotional, impulse-friendly

---

## B2B

### The Buying Committee

B2B purchases involve multiple stakeholders:
- **Champion:** Finds solution, needs ammunition to convince others
- **CFO/Finance:** Needs ROI justification
- **IT/Technical:** Needs integration specs
- **Executive:** Needs strategic alignment

Copy must arm the champion with data for each audience.

### Logic-Heavy Justification

While hooks may be emotional ("Stop wasting time on payroll"), body must provide:
- Hard data and statistics
- ROI calculations
- Case studies with metrics
- Integration specifications
- Security/compliance details

### Jargon as Signal

**Unlike B2C:** Correct industry terminology builds credibility.

- "We speak your language"
- Demonstrates sector expertise
- Signals sophistication to peers

**Example:**
- B2C: "Easy payment processing"
- B2B: "PCI-DSS compliant payment gateway with multi-currency support"

### White Papers & Case Studies

Long-form content demonstrates expertise:
- Gated content generates leads
- Establishes thought leadership
- Provides shareable ammunition
- Builds trust over time

### Risk Mitigation

B2B copy must address fear:
- "What if this fails?"
- "What if my boss asks why I chose this?"
- "Will this integrate with our stack?"

**Include:**
- Implementation support details
- Customer success stories
- SLAs and guarantees
- Migration assistance
- Reference customers

## B2C

### Emotion-First

B2C decisions are often impulsive, identity-driven:
- How does this make me feel?
- What does this say about me?
- Do I want this NOW?

### Sensory Language

Engage the senses:
- "Feel the butter-soft leather"
- "Hear the crisp audio"
- "Taste the difference"

### Emotional Triggers

**FOMO:** "Only 3 left in stock"
**Urgency:** "Sale ends midnight"
**Belonging:** "Join 10,000 happy customers"
**Status:** "The choice of professionals"
**Convenience:** "Delivered to your door tomorrow"

### Identity Reinforcement

Products as identity signals:
- "For the adventurous"
- "Made for creators"
- "The choice for those who know"

### Reducing Rational Friction

Minimise opportunities for second-guessing:
- Fast checkout
- Clear returns policy
- Social proof everywhere
- Limited options (paradox of choice)
