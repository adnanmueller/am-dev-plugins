## Neuro-Copywriting

**The 80/20 Rule:** 80% of buying decisions start in the limbic system (emotion) before being rationalised by the neocortex (logic).

### Structural Flow

1. **Headline/Hook:** Appeal to visceral needs (safety, belonging, status, fear)
2. **Body copy:** Introduce features, specs, logical arguments
3. **CTA:** Reinforce emotional benefit

**Emotion first, logic second.**

---

## Attention Window

Users depart within **8 seconds** if the headline fails.

### Headline Requirements

- Promise specific outcome
- Create urgency or curiosity
- Zero ambiguity
- If user has to "think" about meaning → battle lost

### Examples

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Solutions for Modern Business" | "Cut Payroll Time by 50% This Month" |
| "Quality Products" | "The Only CRM with Native Blockchain" |
| "We Help You Succeed" | "Sleep Better Tonight" |

## Cognitive Load

"Cognitive miserliness" - brain seeks simplest comprehension path.

### Reduction Strategies

1. **Conversational tone:** Reduces "corporate barrier"
   - 66% of marketers agree it improves trust
2. **Simple vocabulary:** Common words over jargon
3. **Short sentences:** One idea per sentence
4. **Active voice:** "We deliver" not "Delivery is provided"
5. **Clear structure:** Predictable patterns

### The Ease Principle

If text is difficult to read, users subconsciously associate difficulty with the product.

---

## Skimming

**73% of users skim** rather than read linearly.

### Skimming-Optimised Copy

- Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold text for key phrases
- Frequent subheadings as signposts
- White space between sections

### The Modular Approach

Each content block must stand alone. User may only read:
- One heading
- One caption
- One bullet point

Every element must sell independently.

## Scannable Formatting

### Bionic Reading Principles

Guide the eye through visual cues:
- **Bold key phrases** (not entire sentences)
- Distinct typographical hierarchy
- Strategic use of colour for emphasis
- Numbered lists for sequences
- Bullet lists for features

### Visual Hierarchy

```
H1: Page Topic (largest, boldest)
  H2: Major Section (clear break)
    H3: Subsection (grouped content)
      Bold: Key terms inline
      Lists: Scannable features
```

## Pinball Pattern

On mobile, eye movement is non-linear "Pinball Pattern" - bouncing between:
- Images
- Buttons
- Bold headers
- Coloured elements

### Implications

1. **Decentralised copy:** Don't assume previous sentence was read
2. **Self-contained blocks:** Each must be valuable alone
3. **Captions sell:** Not just "Man holding phone" but "Man managing entire portfolio in seconds"
4. **Every landing zone = high-value target**

## AI Humanisation

Raw AI output characteristics to fix:
- Repetitive sentence structures
- Overuse of passive voice
- Lack of specific examples
- Uniform sentence lengths
- Generic generalisations

### Humanisation Checklist

- [ ] **Remove hallucinations:** Verify all stats, quotes, claims
- [ ] **Inject experience:** Add anecdotes, case studies, first-person ("I remember when...")
- [ ] **Vary sentence structure:** Short punchy + longer complex = rhythm
- [ ] **Specific over generic:**
  - Bad: "We offer excellent service"
  - Good: "We answer every support ticket within 15 minutes"
- [ ] **Natural idioms:** Careful colloquialisms where appropriate
- [ ] **Burstiness:** Sentence length variation is human marker

### Sentence Rhythm Example

Bad (AI-like):
> "The software provides comprehensive features. It offers robust integration capabilities. The platform delivers reliable performance."

Good (Human):
> "The software does everything. And we mean everything—from invoicing to inventory, with integrations that actually work. No more duct-tape solutions."

## Prompt Engineering

Quality of AI output = Quality of input prompt.

### Effective Prompt Structure

```
Role: "Act as a senior B2B SaaS copywriter"
Tone: "Witty, confident, professional"
Reference: "Similar to [Brand X]"
Constraints: "Avoid jargon like 'synergy' or 'game-changer'"
Focus: "Emphasise time-saving benefit"
Format: "Use short sentences"
```

### Brand Voice Elements to Specify

1. **Formality level:** Casual / Professional / Academic
2. **Personality:** Witty / Serious / Warm / Direct
3. **Vocabulary:** Technical / Simple / Industry-specific
4. **Perspective:** First person / Second person / Third person
5. **Energy:** Urgent / Calm / Enthusiastic / Measured
