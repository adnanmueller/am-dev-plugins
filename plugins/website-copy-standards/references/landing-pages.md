## Friction Reduction

Friction = anything slowing user journey. Confusing copy, too many fields, slow loads.

### Friction Sources

| Source | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Unclear headline | Specific outcome promise |
| Jargon | Plain language |
| Long forms | Essential fields only |
| Ambiguous CTAs | Action-outcome buttons |
| Wall of text | Scannable formatting |
| Hidden pricing | Transparent costs |

### Zero-Friction Principles

1. One clear action per page
2. Remove navigation that distracts from goal
3. Progress indicators for multi-step
4. Trust signals near decision points
5. Mobile-optimised forms

## Cognitive Ease

If text is difficult to process, users associate difficulty with the product.

### Creating Ease

- **Simple words:** "Use" not "Utilise"
- **Short sentences:** One idea each
- **White space:** Room to breathe
- **Familiar patterns:** Standard layouts
- **Visual hierarchy:** Guide the eye

### Readability Target

Grade 8 reading level for broadest accessibility.

---

## Headlines

Headlines must promise specific outcomes, not describe features.

### Feature vs Benefit

| Feature (Weak) | Benefit (Strong) |
|----------------|------------------|
| "Memory Foam Mattress" | "Sleep Better Tonight" |
| "AI-Powered Analytics" | "Know What Your Customers Want Before They Do" |
| "24/7 Support" | "Never Wait More Than 2 Minutes for Help" |
| "Cloud-Based Platform" | "Access Your Data From Anywhere" |

### Headline Formula

```
[Specific Result] + [Timeframe or Qualifier]
```

Examples:
- "Lose 10 Pounds in 30 Days"
- "Double Your Email List This Month"
- "The Only CRM Built for Agencies"

### Statistics

8 out of 10 people read the headline. Only 2 read the rest.
→ Headline carries disproportionate weight.

---

## Social Proof

Reviews and testimonials alleviate last-minute hesitation.

### Optimal Placement

- **Near CTA:** "Join 10,000 happy users" directly above/below button
- **After claims:** Stats backing assertions
- **In hero:** Trust badges, client logos
- **Throughout:** Sprinkled testimonials

### Social Proof Types

1. **Numbers:** "10,000+ customers"
2. **Logos:** Known brands who use product
3. **Testimonials:** Specific outcomes with names
4. **Ratings:** Star ratings, review counts
5. **Certifications:** Trust badges, security seals
6. **Media mentions:** "As seen in..."

### Testimonial Quality

Best testimonials include:
- Specific result ("Increased revenue by 40%")
- Full name and title
- Photo (increases trust)
- Company name/logo
- Before/after if applicable

---

## Forms

Every extra field reduces conversion.

### Field Reduction

**Essential only:** Name + Email (for newsletter)
**Qualify later:** Collect details after initial conversion

### Field Guidelines

- Phone: Optional unless essential
- Company size: Ask in follow-up
- Industry: Use dropdown, not free text
- Address: Only if shipping

### Form UX

- Clear labels (not placeholder-only)
- Inline validation
- Progress for multi-step
- Autofill enabled
- Mobile keyboard types

## AIDA

Attention → Interest → Desire → Action. Adapted for modern attention spans.

### The Hierarchy of Persuasion

```
1. THE HOOK (Headline)
   Grabs attention with urgency or curiosity

2. THE PROBLEM (Empathy)
   Articulates user's pain point
   Builds rapport without manipulation

3. THE SOLUTION (Product)
   Presents offering as specific antidote

4. THE AUTHORITY (Trust)
   Why trust this solution?
   Awards, stats, bios, testimonials

5. THE CALL TO ACTION (Instruction)
   Clear, imperative instruction
```

### Example Flow

```
H1: "Stop Losing Customers to Cart Abandonment"        [Hook]

P: "68% of shoppers abandon their cart. You're losing
    thousands in revenue every month."                 [Problem]

P: "CartSaver automatically recovers abandoned carts
    with personalised email sequences."                [Solution]

[Testimonials + "Trusted by 5000+ stores"]            [Authority]

BUTTON: "Start Recovering Sales - Free Trial"          [Action]
```

## A/B Testing

Continuous testing drives incremental improvement.

### High-Impact Tests

1. **Headlines:** Often largest impact
2. **CTA text:** "Learn More" vs "Get Started"
3. **Button colour:** Though often overstated
4. **Form length:** More vs fewer fields
5. **Social proof placement:** Position and format
6. **Image vs no image:** Hero treatment

### Testing Methodology

1. **One variable:** Test single element per experiment
2. **Sufficient traffic:** Wait for statistical significance
3. **Clear hypothesis:** "Changing X will improve Y because Z"
4. **Document learnings:** Build institutional knowledge

### Common Wins

| Change | Typical Lift |
|--------|--------------|
| Feature → Benefit headline | 10-30% |
| Generic → Specific CTA | 5-15% |
| Long form → Short form | 10-25% |
| Adding trust badges | 5-10% |
| Adding testimonial near CTA | 5-15% |
