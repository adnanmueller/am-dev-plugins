description: "Removes common AI-generated text patterns that make writing obviously machine-produced. Use when: (1) Writing or editing any text content, (2) User requests human-sounding or natural writing, (3) User wants to avoid AI slop or AI tells, (4) Creating content that shouldn't read as AI-generated. Apply automatically when generating prose, articles, emails, or creative content."

# AI Text Humaniser

Transform AI-sounding text into natural, human prose by eliminating telltale patterns.

## Core Principle

Write like a knowledgeable person having a conversation, not an AI trying to sound authoritative.

## Patterns to Eliminate

### Punctuation Tells

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| Em dashes (—) for asides | Commas, parentheses, or restructure the sentence |
| Excessive colons before lists | Integrate naturally: "such as X, Y, and Z" |
| Semicolons in casual writing | Full stops or commas |

### Filler Phrases (Delete Entirely)

- "It's worth noting that..."
- "It's important to remember that..."
- "In today's world/age/society..."
- "Let's dive in / explore / unpack..."
- "At its core..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "In the realm of..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "The fact of the matter is..."
- "Needless to say..."
- "It goes without saying..."

### Buzzwords and Corporate-Speak

| AI Slop | Human Alternative |
|---------|-------------------|
| delve | look at, examine, explore |
| leverage | use |
| utilize | use |
| robust | strong, solid, reliable |
| seamless | smooth, easy |
| cutting-edge | new, modern, advanced |
| game-changer | significant, important |
| groundbreaking | new, innovative |
| landscape (metaphorical) | field, area, situation |
| navigate (challenges) | handle, deal with, work through |
| resonate | connect, appeal, matter |
| elevate | improve, raise, lift |
| empower | enable, help, let |
| synergy | working together, combined effect |
| holistic | complete, whole, full |
| paradigm shift | change, shift |
| ecosystem | system, network, community |
| stakeholders | people involved, those affected |
| bandwidth | time, capacity |
| circle back | return to, revisit |
| deep dive | detailed look, thorough review |

### Overwrought Metaphors

Avoid: tapestry, symphony, mosaic, beacon, cornerstone, pillar, fabric (of society), dance (between concepts), journey (for processes), unlock (potential).

Use plain language instead.

### Weak Intensifiers

| Remove | Better Approach |
|--------|-----------------|
| very, really, extremely, incredibly | Choose a stronger base word |
| crucial, paramount, essential, vital | Use sparingly; often redundant |
| absolutely, definitely, certainly | Usually add nothing |

### Hedging and Padding

| AI Pattern | Fix |
|------------|-----|
| "One could argue that..." | State the argument directly |
| "It could be said that..." | Just say it |
| "There is a sense in which..." | Be specific |
| "In many ways..." | Name the ways or cut it |
| "To some extent..." | Quantify or remove |
| "It is generally accepted..." | By whom? Cite or cut |

### Mechanical Transitions

| Robotic | Natural |
|---------|---------|
| Furthermore, Moreover, Additionally | Also, And, Plus (or just start the new point) |
| In conclusion, To summarize | Cut entirely; your conclusion should be self-evident |
| That being said, Having said that | But, However, Still |
| With that in mind | So, Given this |
| It is also worth mentioning | Also, (or integrate naturally) |

### Structural Tells

- Avoid three-part lists in every paragraph
- Don't mirror the user's phrasing back at them
- Vary sentence length (mix short and long)
- Don't start consecutive sentences with the same word
- Avoid the pattern: [General statement]. [Elaboration]. [Example].

### Opening Line Clichés

Never begin with:
- "In the world of..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "In an era where..."
- "[Topic] is a fascinating..."
- "[Topic] has become increasingly..."
- "Have you ever wondered..."
- "Picture this:"
- "Imagine a world where..."

Start with your actual point instead.

## Application Method

1. Write the content naturally first
2. Scan for listed patterns
3. Replace or remove each instance
4. Read aloud; if it sounds like a chatbot, revise
5. Prefer short, direct sentences to long, qualified ones

## Quick Self-Check

Before finalising, ask:
- Would a human actually write this sentence?
- Does this sound like a person or a press release?
- Can I cut this word without losing meaning?
- Am I hedging because I'm uncertain, or just because it sounds "safe"?
